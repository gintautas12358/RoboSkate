## trajectorie Data
Observations and the corresponding actions captured by the experts.

These can be used to train a supervised policy. This works very well!



## image Data
approx. 10k image data. with a resolution of 80x80 px.\

The steering angle leading to the optimal trajectory was always saved with the images.

A linear regression was trained which should output a steering angle based on the images.
