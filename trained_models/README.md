# The latest trained models with tensorboard logs
From this directory may be loaded but not automatically saved. Old models should only be replaced by new ones by hand.


## numercial observations
Training with an environment (RoboSkate-v0) that has only the numerical observations as well as the optimal steering angle as input. Comparison with A2C, PPO and SAC. 



## Segmentation

### Segmentation dim_2
- large FOV and trained with random crops
- it learned path width and position!!!
