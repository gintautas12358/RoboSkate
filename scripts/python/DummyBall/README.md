We were also provided with a simpler version of the RoboSkate environment called DummyBall game, 
which served as a platform to easily test our implementations. It is a game where the player controls a ball with left
and right arrow keys, while the it rolls forward. The goal is to reach the end of the track by avoiding falling off.
